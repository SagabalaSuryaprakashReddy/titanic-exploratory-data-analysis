# Titanic Data Analysis – Task 3

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns using Python data science libraries.

## Objectives
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values
- Remove irrelevant columns
- Create new features such as Age Group and Family Size
- Analyze survival rates based on different factors
- Visualize insights using plots and heatmaps

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Filled missing **Age** values using mean
- Dropped **Cabin** column due to many missing entries
- Created **FamilySize** feature using SibSp and Parch
- Created **AgeGroup** categories using age ranges

## Analysis Performed
- Survival rate by **Age Group**
- Survival rate by **Embarkation Port**
- Survival rate by **Family Size**
- **Age Distribution Histogram**
- **Correlation Heatmap**

## Results
The analysis revealed meaningful survival patterns across age groups, family sizes, and embarkation ports, demonstrating the importance of feature engineering and visualization in data analysis.
